# Workshop Introduction

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Deployment of application infrastructure (and apps) using code based assets.

Some potential options for IaC:

- Scripts, SDKs, and managed code
- Provider-specific tooling
- Configuration Management / Provisioning tooling

Benefits:

- Agility
- Control
- Documentation
- Idempotency
- Version control
- Validation
- Reuse
- Continuous

## Terraform

Open Sourced, cross-platform, and somewhat mature option for IaC.

- Clean, simple language (Hashicorp Configuration Language, HCL2)
- Extensible  through Terraform providers (multi-cloud, cross prem)
- Runtime and providers built-in Go
- Terraform Configuration is the deployable piece
- Multiple tools for testing and continuous integration / delivery

## Next Module

In the next module, you will create a simple resource using Terraform.
