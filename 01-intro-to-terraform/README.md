- Configuration Management / Provisioning tooling

Benefits:

- Agility
- Control
- Documentation
- Version controlled
- Validation
- Reuse
- Continious / Cloud Native

## Terraform

Open Sourced, cross-platform, and relatively mature option for IaC.

- Runtime is built in Go
- Providers (also built in Go) bring cloud / service specific functionality
- Terraform Configuration are the deployable piece
- Multiple tools for testing and continuous integration / delivery
