# Terraform Workspaces

## Module Overview

In many cases, a Terraform configuration will be applied to multiple environments, perhaps test, QA, and production. Terraform includes a namespacing system named workspaces for logically separating state between environments. In this module, you will create multiple workspaces, deploy a configuration to each, and delete a workspace.

## First Workspace

List the Terraform workspaces with the `terraform workspace list` command. To start, you should have only the `default` workspace.

```
terraform workspace list
```

Create a new workspace with the `terraform workspace new` command.

```
terraform workspace new test-environment
```

Update the `hello-world` app configuration to interpolate the workspace name into the configuration. This can be done with the `${terraform.workspace}` syntax. In this example, the Azure **resource group name** and container **dns name** are appended with the workspace name.

```
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "hello-world" {
  name     = "${var.resource_group}-${terraform.workspace}"
  location = "${var.location}"
}

resource "azurerm_container_group" "hello-world" {
  name                = "${lower(var.container-name)}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.hello-world.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.hello-world.name}"
  ip_address_type     = "public"
  dns_name_label      = "${var.dns-prefix}-${terraform.workspace}"
  os_type             = "linux"

  container {
    name   = "hello-world"
    image  = "${var.container-image}"
    cpu    = "0.5"
    memory = "1.5"
    ports {
      port      = 80
      protocol  = "TCP"
    }
  }
}
```

Create a new plan for the hello-world configuration.

```
terraform plan --out plan.out
```

Apply the plan.


```
terraform apply plan.out
```

## Second Workspace

Create a second workspace with the `terraform workspace new` command.

```
terraform workspace new production-environment
```

Create a new plan for the hello-world configuration.


```
terraform plan --out plan.out
```

Apply the plan.


```
terraform apply plan.out
```

List the Terraform workspaces with the `terraform workspace list` command. You should now see the two new workspaces.

```
$ terraform workspace list

  default
* production-environment
  test-environment
```

Taking a look at the backend, we can see the state file for each workspace.

You can also notice, that we now have an instance of the application for each workspace, each in its own Azure resource group.

```
$ az group list -o table

Name                                Location    Status
----------------------------------  ----------  ---------
hello-world                         eastus      Succeeded
hello-world-production-environment  eastus      Succeeded
hello-world-test-environment        eastus      Succeeded
```

## Remove Workspace

To remove a workspace, first, destroy the current configuration and delete the workspace.

Switch to the `test-environment` workspace.

```
terraform workspace select test-environment
```

Destroy the configuration.

```
terraform destroy
```

Switch to the `default` workspace.

```
terraform workspace select default
```

Delete the `test-environment` workspace.

```
terraform workspace delete test-environment
```

## Issues with workspaces

Workspaces are great, but consider the following issues:

- All state is stored in the same backend. This poses both an issue around access control and error-prone management experience.

Consider using a well-formed directory structure with different backends for production level state isolation.
